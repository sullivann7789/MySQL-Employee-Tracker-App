## Description:
- This program allows users to create a database of all of their employees at their company, with department, job name, salary, employee id, name, and manager id using mysql, inquirer, and  Node.js
### Why This Project Was Made:
- This project was created so employers and management could easily keep track of their workforce and manage their company through a relative database which they can look at, update, and create themselves through a simple  command line interface program with intuitive design. 
        
## Installation:
1. Clone the code into a repository on your computer from this github repo.
2. Log into your mysql on your terminal.
3. Run ``` source db/employee.sql ``` on your CLI or terminal and exit your mysql.
4. Then, run ``` npm i && node index```
5. Log into your mysql using the command line prompt questions, after each answer, hit enter
6. Then, simply follow the prompts and you now have access to your database which will be saved on your computer storage.
7. To access your database again, simply run the single code line ``` node index ``` once in your Employee Tracker folder and everything will load as it did before.
        
## Usage:
- Clone the github repo into a folder of your choosing and then follow installation instructions, once finished all you need to do is run the code ``` node index ``` anytime you are in your employee tracker folder and it will work correctly
